# HoopDreams-API
A GraphQL API that can be queried for basketball players, fields, games and their relations.

## Prerequisites
  Make sure to have Node and NPM installed.

## Start-up
  Using your favorite shell, browse to the root folder and enter:
    
    npm install && npm start
    
  Note: If you encounter an error regartding event-stream, simply delete node_modules and package-lock.json and try again.
  
  The project will get the required dependencies and run afterwards on localhost, port 4000.
  
## Usage
  **The connection string for the database is, for obvious reasons, not included in the repository. Feel free to contact me (smarifreyr30@gmail.com) to gain access to the connection string.**
  
  Open your browser at localhost:4000 and, using the provided GUI, query the API using GraphQL. On the right hand-side of the screen, a schema for the API can be viewed to help understand what kind of queries are possible.
  See GraphQL documentation to learn more about how to structure the queries (https://graphql.org/learn/queries/).
